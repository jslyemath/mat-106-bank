She measures her remaining twine before starting her projects. She has 5 ft of twine on one spool, and 4 ft of twine on another spool. Her first project requires 4 ft of twine, her second project requires 4 1/5 ft, and her third project requires 2 ft. Will Cora have enough twine to make all three projects? Why or why not?", "solution": "To find out if Cora has enough twine to complete all three projects, we first calculate the total amount of twine available. Adding the two spools gives us 5 ft + 4 ft, which equals 9 ft of twine. Then, we add up the amount of twine needed for each project. Summing up 4 ft + 4 1/5 ft + 2 ft gives us a total of 10 1/5 ft of twine needed overall.
